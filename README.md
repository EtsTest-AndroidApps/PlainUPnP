# Rewrite of UI layer is in progress

PlainUPnP - intially DroidUPnP - is an UPnP control point application for android.

PlainUPnP discovers your home UPnP device, content provider and renderer.
It allows you to browse your UPnP content directory, select the media you want
to use and allows you to play it on your connected television or any UPnP renderer
compatible device.

It also allows you to use your android device as an UPnP content provider.

This is a rewrite of trishika's [DroidUPnP](https://github.com/trishika/DroidUPnP), original project can be found [here](https://github.com/trishika/DroidUPnP).
